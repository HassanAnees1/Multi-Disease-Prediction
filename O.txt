The project will utilize machine learning models to forecast healthcare-related outcomes, focusing on improving patient care and resource management.


Milestone 1: Data Collection, Exploration, and Preprocessing Objectives:
•	Collect relevant healthcare data, explore the dataset for trends, and preprocess it for further modeling.
Tasks:
1.	Data Collection:
o	Obtain healthcare datasets (e.g., patient records, clinical data, or health metrics) that contain key features like age, medical history, test results, treatments, and patient outcomes.
o	Ensure the dataset contains relevant health information and is structured for predictive modeling.
2.	Data Exploration:
o	Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the dataset.
o	Identify key features, the distribution of health-related data points, and any potential patterns.
o	Identify missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.
3.	Data Preprocessing:
o	Handle missing data using techniques such as imputation or removal.
o	Normalize or standardize data for model compatibility.
o	Encode categorical variables if necessary (e.g., encoding medical conditions or diagnoses).
Deliverables:
•	Dataset Exploration Report: A report that summarizes the data's characteristics, distribution of features, and any data quality issues discovered.
•	EDA Notebook: A Jupyter notebook with visualizations and summary statistics such as histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps.

o	Use statistical methods such as correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, or feature importance analysis to identify key factors affecting healthcare outcomes.
3.	Data Visualization:
o	Create compelling visualizations like heatmaps, trend lines, and scatter plots to highlight trends, outliers, and significant patterns in health metrics.
o	Develop interactive dashboards or charts (using tools like Plotly, Dash, or Tableau) to enable stakeholders to easily view and interpret the data.
Deliverables:
•	Cleaned Dataset and Analysis Report: A detailed report outlining the data cleaning steps, analysis results, and insights gained from health metrics.
•	Visualizations of Health Trends: Interactive charts and dashboards that visually represent health trends, anomalies, and prediction insights.
